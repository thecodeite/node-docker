# Docker Node

An example of a node app running in Docker

## Steps

1. Install Docker for Mac [https://www.docker.com/docker-mac] (/shrug if you're on Windows)

2. `yarn build` (note you don't need to do `yarn` to pull down dependencies)

3. `yarn docker-start` to start a container running the app

4. Go to [http://localhost:8020] to feel the magic

5. Run `yarn docker-rm` once you're done to clean up
